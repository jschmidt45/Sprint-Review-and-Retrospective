# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is an imporant step in the development of an application. After all, the product created should be something that the intended end-users will enjoy. The first part about implementing user needs is understanding what the software is intended to do. After that, impementing features that make the software more user friendly
is a great way to begin curating it to the needs of the end-user. Creating user stories is invaluable, since it will give you an actual understanding of what many end-users are looking for in a product. By using these user stories, the team can then make additions or adjustments to ensure that their product will be something that users enjoy.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Normally, I approach developing programs by first setting up everything that I would need. This can include classes or including different libraries, etc. Then I start by going through and developing one feature at a time while still considering future needs. I think an important agile practice to implement is the development of functional, independent pieces of code
that can be individually tested. This way, I could start by making sure each feature is functional and then put everything together towards the end to finish the program.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think there are many ways to be a good team member in software development. I think a very important component to this is understanding what your team needs from you. I think being a good team member starts with being able to contribute to the team in a meaningful way. Secondly, I think open communication is incredibly important as well. As we talked about many times
with the Scrum Team, communication is extremely important to developing software in a coordinated fashion. The last point that I'll cover is the willingness to help out other team members. A team where every member is willing to step up when needed and help out is likely a team that functions very well.
